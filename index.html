        to people the importance of certain sections</h3>
      <p>The paragraph tag is used to create a block of text</p>
      <p id ="my_id">It is important to note here that the p tag is a block tag
        meaning that each time the tage is used it will generate a new line.
        Furthermore, this paragrapg is tagged with an id.</p>
      <p onclick = "alert('This is acheived by adding onclick = alert within the opening tag!')">Click me!</p>

      <a href="index.html" title="Titles are good to use because they make
      websites more accessible">The 'a' tag can be used to introduce hyperlinks or
       references to other pages (hover over me and click me!).</a>
      <a href="http://www.google.com" title="New tab" target="_blank"><div>
        Div tags surround-able by the a tag and
        can make the entire div a hyperlink. references can be relative (a .html
        file in the same directory as the current file) or absolute(a link to a
        and this one is absolute. Additionally, this link also opens in a new tab
        via target = _blank.
      </div></a>
      <a href="#headings">Lastly, a tags can reference parts of the html document
      that they're in. This one links to the first section and if this document
      was long enough would jump to it.</a>
      <h4>The following paragraph is an exemplification of character entity
        references</h4>
      <p>The less than symbol does not normally appear when typed but can be
        included like this &lt; and greater than as &gt; and ampersand as &amp;.
        The character entity references are generally structured as and ampersand
        followed by some letters and a semicolon ;. Furthermore&nbsp;the&nbsp;non&nbsp;-&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;space&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;used&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;text&nbsp;move&nbsp;together.</p>
