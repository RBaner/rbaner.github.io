Here's picture of the final thing! It's convenient, comfortable, yellow, and I still use it every time I get the
groceries.

This post will cover how I made up a problem and thought of a solution for it, and there will be a second post about the
finer details of creating the above piece.

<br /><br />

  <h2><u>Defining the Problem</u></h2>
</center>

Something that has been bugging me for a while is trying to keep the screen door to our garage open. Sometimes I have to
make a lot of trips for groceries or I gotta bring in some big speakers or suitcases and its really inconvenient to
stop. You gotta put down the stuff, open the door and do some awkward shimmy holding the door with your back or leg. Or
someone else has to stand there and open it. Sometimes we try to wedge something between the stairs and the steps, but
that too is annoying. Whatever you use, it needs to be taller than a step and heavy enough so that it doesn't slide.
It's one of those things that usually never bothers you, but fight this door on a bad day and you consider just removing
it all together.

<br /><br />

Anyway, here's a picture of the situation:

<br /><br />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a "http://i.imgur.com/mar1jq0.jpg" onclick='window.open("http://i.imgur.com/mar1jq0.jpg");return false;'><img
            alt="" border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/mar1jq0.jpg" height="" width="450" /></a>
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: center; width: 300px;">
          <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mar1jq0.jpg" target="_blank">View from inside the house</a></div>

      </td>
      <td>
        <a "http://i.imgur.com/It5uyhl.jpg" onclick='window.open("http://i.imgur.com/It5uyhl.jpg");return false;'><img
            alt="" border="0" src="http://i.imgur.com/It5uyhl.jpg" height="" width="450" /></a>
        <br />
        <div style="text-align: center; width: 300px;">
          <a href="http://i.imgur.com/It5uyhl.jpg" target="_blank">Current solution: the air pump</a></div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br />

Trial and error proved that our fair air pump to be the most capable, but only when you place it <i>just right</i>,
otherwise it slides or falls over, so you still have to stand there and try wedging it over and over and its just a real
pain.

<br /><br />

Okay so now how do we solve this problem? There are so many different ways to keep a door open, so we start by listing
about our constraints, in no particular order. This way we stop any impossible or ridiculous ideas from crowding out the
good ones. Here are some limitations for our screen door dilemma.

<ul>
  <li>Can't put holes in the wall</li>
  <li>Shouldn't get in the way of the path</li>
  <li>Can't be too bulky/expensive</li>
  <li>Ideally shouldn't required power</li>
  <li>Should not wear out or require maintenance</li>
  <li>Should be convenient to use</li>
  <li>Should be easy to construct / 3D print / design</li>
</ul>

<center>
  <h2><u>Idea Birth</u></h2>
</center>

Keeping these things in mind, some ideas are disqualified. I could've installed a rope and pulley system where the door
opens as you reel in the rope, and then you can lock the reel in place. It could even be powered by a motor, like a
winch. But pulleys can wear out and ropes can loosen or break, so there's too many methods of failure. Plus we don't
really need to hold the door at a certain angle, we just need it to be held open all the way, so the whole part of
reeling the rope is really unnecessary.
<br /><br />
My next thought was to create some kind of push-lock(illustrated below) that the door would attach to, but to do that
requires a surface to mount the lock to(like our white bookshelf). Unfortunately, the bookshelf is a not a wall, so if
it get moved at all, you have to try and move it back exactly in place or redesign and remake a piece. Also, to 3D print
something like this would be a bad idea since the plastic would wear out as the lock is snapped and unsnapped.
<br /><br />
Another version of the last idea is to just use a pin to connect the surface and the door together, like shown. While
this solves the wear and tear problem, the bookshelf moving even an inch still messes up the system. Not to mention that
the bookshelf itself might get replaced, and I'd rather just one and done this project anyway.

<br /><br /><br />

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Q7VHfZy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span
      style="color: #666666;"><img border="2" src="http://i.imgur.com/Q7VHfZy.jpg" style="cursor: move;"
        width="700" /></span></a></div>

<br />
After thinking about the way we wedge the poor air pump under the door, I got the idea to design a wedge to hold open
the door. Only this wedge wouldn't exist on the outside of the door, it would sit inside the door hinge. Looking back at
that first picture of the "view from inside the house", there is a gap created between the door and the white wall
frame. I took a good stare at it, and figured a 3D print in the shape of that gap would stop the door from closing. Now
all I had to do was figure out that shape and get it printed!

<br /><br />

<center>
  <h2><u>Initial Sketch</u></h2>
</center>

So I started by just free handing a sketch of the piece. You can see how the red and green line correspond to the hinge
space in real life. To make things simpler I set the origin to be the left point of the green line, which is where the
corner wall is. I got my measurements by just sticking a ruler near each side and squinting. This way I get a quick
visual on what the shape is, and I get a feel for which measurements are most important. The important dimensions I will
measure rigorously with the caliper, and the not so important ones I just make a guess or let it be determined by
everything else.

<br /><br /><br />

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img border="”0″" height="450" src="http://i.imgur.com/KSb8FRT.png" width="”250”" />
      </td>
      <td><img border="”0″" height="450" src="http://i.imgur.com/aI4Ch0i.jpg" width="”250”" />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br /><br />

For example, the red. green, and blue lines are important dimensions, because they are all definite lengths in the real
world. By knowing where and how long these three lines are, we automatically are given the length of the orange line.
That's great, now we don't ever need to worry about measuring the length of the orange line.

<br /><br />

The other very important dimension to determine is the angle currently showing 103.29 degrees. By adjusting this angle
the red line rotates, controlling how far open the door is when wedged. Making the angle smaller sort of pulls the red
line up, and forces the door to open wider. Going the other way, and increasing the angle past 103.29 makes the wedge
narrower, letting the door close more before it locks in the wedge. Here's an example of tweaking around the angle.

<br /><br /><br />

<br /><br />

So setting the angle too large isn't a big deal, as the door just won't be all the way open. But set this angle too
small, and the wedge will never fit, we will err on the side of a larger than needed angle.

<br /><br />

  <h2><u>First Draft</u></h2>
</center>

The plan from here is to extrude the shape, and use it as a wedge between the door and the wall. I want to print two two
of these, so the door frame isn't pushing against a single point. To keep the two pieces together, I figure a thin bar
can connect the two. And lastly, to make it easier to insert and remove the wedges I want to add some little tabs to
grab em with. So I just added in a couple more extrudes and had a prototype design. Now you can see how with just using
a ruler and some guesswork, the first draft of the design!
