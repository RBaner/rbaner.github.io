            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>This is a continuing blog post for any Project Euler problems I've solved that I found interesting (or at least difficult!). Most of my solutions are written in Python, but that will start changing as I start learning more languages.</p>

            <h1>Problem 357:</h1>
            <div class="problem_statement">
                <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
                <p>Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.<br />
                It can be seen that for every divisor d of 30, d+30/d is prime.<br />
                <br />
                Find the sum of all positive integers n not exceeding 100 000 000<br />
                such that for every divisor d of n, d+n/d is prime.</p>
            </div>
            <br \>
            <p>A couple of inital observations are that any n that fits the description is not going to be: odd or contain squares in its prime factorization. For any odd n with one of its divisors d, the experession d+n/d evaluates to an even (not prime) value since d and n/d are both odd. If an n has a square p in its prime factorization then we end up with p+n/p which is divisible by p and therefore not prime.</p>
            <p>This however doesn't really narrow it down much considering the size of the sum, plus the mobius function to identify non square functions isn't fast for the amount of even values we have to consider. Instead we make the identification that every number will generate the term 1+n/1 for divisor 1 and therefore only numbers one less than a prime should be considered. This does reduce our potential candidates by a lot but producing primes up to 100 000 000 is still expensive.</p>
            <p>My last observation is that any candidate cannot be equivalent to 4 or 6 modulo 10. 4mod10 implies a 2^2 in the prime facotization and 6mod10 implies that for some d, d+n/d is equivalent to 5mod10 which is not prime. There are some 8mod10 numbers that satisfy the constraints since a non-square number equivalent to 8mod10 doesn't immedietly produce a contradiction.</p>

        or =6(mod10)(implies there exists a d+(n/d) that is divisible
        by 5). Then we screen for numbers for which the mobius function
        returns 1 or -1 so we don't check numbers with non-distinct
        prime factors. Any numbers left are manually checked by pgen(i-1)"""

            This algorithm took about 7 minutes (which is by all means horrible) but it was the first &#62;100 problem I'd solved so I was happy.

            <h3>Improvements:</h3>
            I think this algorithm could be considerably sped up by skipping taxing operations in favor for guess and check since the conditions requre that every d+n/d sum be prime and I doubt the likelihood of the majority of a candidate's d+n/d sums being prime while still having some disqualifying sums. Python has an any() function that takes any amount of booleans as its arguments and immedietly returns false on any of them evaluating to false which seems ideal for this problem.
